# NodeJS-Vidly
This is a project that was done by me in the NodeJS course. The project was intended for learning through the course. 

It uses the following languages/tools:
  1) Node.JS
  2) Express
  3) MongoDB
  4) Postman
  5) JOI Validation

This project is a movie rental API called Vidly. It consists of movies of different genres, which can be rented by customers.
The MongoDB is used to store the data processed through the API.
